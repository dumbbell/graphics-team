The **X Developer's Conference** (XDC) is held every year, in
alternation between Europe and North America. This is a great
occasion for users and developers interested in the graphics stack
to meet in person and discuss. [This year's edition was in Bordeaux,
France](http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Events/XDC2014/), from October 8th
through 10th.

François Tigeot, from DragonFlyBSD, and I attended the conference. We
met Matthieu Herrb from OpenBSD there. The goal was to show that BSDs
are still interested in the graphics stack and that we want to work with
the community. I think that was a huge success!

We had a warm welcome: people were asking questions about how video
hardware was supported, how desktop environments were doing, how we are
working with the kernel drivers, and so on.

## Projects impacting FreeBSD

[Talks](http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Events/XDC2014/Program/) and discussions
were very good. I'll sum up here what may impact FreeBSD specifically.

**Alex Deucher (AMD)** talked about their ["amdgpu"
project](http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Events/XDC2014/XDC2014DeucherAMD/). The
purpose is to have a single open-source kernel driver, instead of the
"radeon” driver and the Catalyst driver. "radeon” will support older
generation, while "amdgpu” will support new hardware. Proprietary
components will all be in userland.

**Andy Ritger (NVIDIA)** presented two projects. First, their proposal
to allow [multiple vendor-specific OpenGL libraries to live on the same
system](http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Events/XDC2014/XDC2014RitgerGLABI/) and
even in the same process. In particular, this means no more headache
for package maintainers with libGL.so conflicts. The second project is
to change the NVIDIA proprietary kernel module to [register as a KMS
driver](http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Events/XDC2014/XDC2014RitgerEGLNonMesa/).
This will allow them to be compatible with Wayland in the
process. Andy told me they had no special requirement on
the DRM device-independent code at that time. But our
DRM is aging and it's in our interest to complete [its
update](https://wiki.freebsd.org/Graphics/Update_DRM_generic_code_to_Linux_3.8).

During discussions with the many **Nouveau developers** present, it
appears that porting Nouveau to FreeBSD shouldn't be that hard. The
greatest difficulty is TTM and we have it for the Radeon driver already.

Regarding other kernel drivers, I talked with some **ARM developers**
about the license issue, because most of the drivers are GPLv2
currently. Their choice of the license was most of the time a default
choice, not something they firmly want. In fact, they would love to see
the hardware supported by other OS and therefore are open to changing
that, though they are of course not alone to decide. A transition to a
dual GPLv2/MIT license model is already underway for the AllWinner GPU
driver.

I spoke to two **libinput maintainers** about what was required to port
it to FreeBSD. [libinput's
goal](http://who-t.blogspot.fr/2014/09/libinput-common-input-stack-for-wayland.html)
is to unify input handling for both X.Org and Wayland, instead of having
multiple `xf86-input-*` drivers. It depends on evdev which is [being
added to FreeBSD](https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCode2014/evdev_Touchscreens)
(GSoC 2014). It also depends on epoll which can be replaced by kqueue.
Finally, it optionally uses udev for input devices discovery, something
we can implement.

Speaking about **udev**, I learned that it's not going away anytime
soon, according to people close to systemd developers. This contradicts
what we heard 6 month ago at FOSDEM. That's why we may resume the
udev implementation project we planned some time ago, and add it to
[libdevq](https://github.com/freebsd/libdevq).

## The BSD track

On the last day, there was a BSD track where [François
Tigeot](http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Events/XDC2014/XDC2014TigeotDragonFlyBSD/), [Matthieu
Herrb](http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Events/XDC2014/XDC2014HerrbOpenBSD/),
[and I](http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Events/XDC2014/XDC2014PedronFreeBSD/)
presented the status of the graphics stack on our respective OS. I was
first and, beside a couple questions, I had mostly kind comments from
people appreciating our presence and efforts.

To conclude, I would like to thank Martin Peres for organizing this
XDC and for encouraging us during last FOSDEM to talk about the BSDs.
I'd like to thank everyone for the really friendly moments we had. We
all arranged to meet at the [next FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2015/) in
Brussels, I'm definitely looking forward to it!
