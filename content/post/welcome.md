We finally took time to recover the content of the previous lost blog,
hosted on `http://blogs.freebsdish.org/graphics/` and create this new
blog.

Dave Cottlehuber (dch on #freebsd-xorg) was of a great help
to achieve that! He recovered the articles [from the Web
archives](http://web.archive.org/web/20150905061215/http://blogs.freebsdish.org/graphics/)
and made them available to us. He also suggested the tools
we are now using to create and host this blog: [GitHub
pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/).
